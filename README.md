# TextCrawl v.20

TextCrawl is a Python application that analyzes text data to identify and display the frequency of words. It allows users to input text data from either local files or via URLs. The results can be displayed either as total word counts or filtered to show only the most common words.

## Features
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Analyze text files to find and count the most frequent words, excluding common words like 'the', 'is', etc.
- **Support for Local and Web Text Files**: Load text data from local files or directly from URLs.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Simple and intuitive command-line interface for easy navigation and usage.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Includes detailed error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- "requests" library for Python
- Ensure you have a subdirectory named "Textfiles" to place .txt files in to use Option 1
- Otherwise, a URL to a .txt file will suffice to use Option 2

To install "requests", run the following command:
- "pip install requests"

### Usage
To utilize the script, run the following command:
- "python textcrawl_v.20.py"
