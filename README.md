# TextCrawl

This is a simple program I wrote to solidify some basic Python skills following my first month of self-directed learning. To begin, you need only to place a .txt file in the same directory as the program and then tell the program which file you wish to scan (include the .txt in the filename. From there, TextCrawl will read your file and then parse, normalize, and add them to a dictionary data construct (except for very common words). Finally, the program will display the Top 25 most common words in the file. 

I intend to iterate on this project further to solidify my understanding of programming and to teach myself 'best practices' in coding.
